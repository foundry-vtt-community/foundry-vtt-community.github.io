Download the Linux version of Foundry and place it in a suitable location, such as **~/FoundryVTT**. Extract the contents (you may need to install zip using `pkg install zip`). The zip does not contain a top-level directory, so be sure you extract into an empty directory.

In order to run the Foundry server we need to install `node.js`. In a terminal run `pkg install node`.

With `node.js` installed we can now run the Foundry server. Assuming you placed and named the extracted Foundry folder in your home directory and named it **FoundryVTT** you can type the following command replacing the folder names if needed
```
cd ~/FoundryVTT
```
Press the `return` key.

Now that we are inside the Foundry folder we can run the Foundry server by running this command
```
node resources/app/main.js
```
Press the `return` key.

You should now see something similar to this in your terminal
```

With the Foundry server running you can now access it via your browser by typing `localhost:30000` in the URL bar.

To shut the Foundry server down press both the `control` + `c` keys at the same time with the terminal in focus.

You can save on some disk space by deleting the Linux-specific binary files.  You can delete the unneeded ones with the following command:

<!--- {% raw %} --->
```
rm -rf chrome* *.dat *.so locales *.bin *.pak swiftshader
<!--- {% endraw %} --->```
