# Hamachi

Hamachi is a really simple tool which allows you to create a virtual private network which simulates a LAN-type connection that allows other people to connect to you as an alternative if you are unable to port forward. You can download it [here.](https://www.vpn.net)

After installing it it will prompt you to create an account so sort out such formalities.

After that you will be met with this little screen.

Make sure to write down and memorize the servers ID and password, this will be used so that other people can connect to your server.
