# What is a Macro?
A macro is a set of commands (such as a roll, a message, or a Javascript scriptlet) that Foundry can execute when the associated macro button is pressed.

Macros were added in Foundry VTT version `0.4.4`

## Community Contributed Macros
A community-contributed repository of Macros can be found here: [github](https://github.com/foundry-vtt-community/macros).

# Macro Types
## Chat Macros

Chat macros are chat commands that have been saved for later reuse. See section on [Chat commands](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Chat/)

## Script Macros

Script Macros in Foundry use the underlying [JavaScript API](https://foundryvtt.com/api) to execute various commands. The API respects the permissions of the user executing the macro, so players cannot delete your big bad evil guy for example.

See also: [Learning API](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/API-Learning-API/), and [API Snippets](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/API-Snippets/) (many of them can be used in a Macros)
Some examples of using script macros follows.

### Script Macros Examples

#### Random Table Roll 

```js
const table = game.tables.entities.find(t => t.name === "MY TABLE NAME");
table.draw();
```

Replace the table name with the one you want to use.

#### Rolling a skill check for DnD 5e

Here are a few simple scripts useful for rolling skill checks using the dnd5e system.

```js
// This would roll an athletics skill check for the players character. 
// Just replace 'ath' with the appropriate skill abbreviation for the
// skill you'd like to roll.
character.rollSkill('ath');

// This would be used if a player controls more than one character.
// It would roll the check for which ever token the player has selected.
actor.rollSkill('ath');
```

List of skill abbreviations:

* "acr" => Acrobatics
* "ani" => Animal Handling
* "arc" => Arcana
* "ath" => Athletics
* "dec" => Deception
* "his" => History
* "ins" => Insight
* "itm" => Intimidation
* "inv" => Investigation
* "med" => Medicine
* "nat" => Nature
* "prc" => Perception
* "prf" => Performance
* "per" => Persuasion
* "rel" => Religion
* "slt" => Sleight of Hand
* "ste" => Stealth
* "sur" => Survival

#### Rolling an attribute check for DnD 5e

These are examples for rolling an attribute check.

```js
// This would pop up a dialog asking if you'd like
// to roll a Strength Test or a Strength Save.
// Just replace "str" with the appropriate ability
// abbreviation.
character.rollAbility("str");

// or this for a player that is controlling multiple
// tokens.
actor.rollAbility("str");

// This would skip the dialog and roll an ability test
character.rollAbilityTest("str");

// And this would skip the dialog and roll an ability save
character.rollAbilitySave("str");
```

List of ability abbreviations:

* "str" => Strength
* "dex" => Dexterity
* "con" => Constitution
* "int" => Intelligence
* "wis" => Wisdom
* "cha" => Charisma
