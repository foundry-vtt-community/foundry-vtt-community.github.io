When building a new system, you have several options to choose from. You can copy an existing system (depending on its license) like the Simple World-building system, you can use a system generator, or you could start from scratch and have total control.

## Option 1: Download

1. Download a zip version of the [Boilerplate System](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate/-/archive/master/boilerplate-master.zip)
2. Extract it to the <!-- {% raw %} -->`/Data/systems`<!-- {% endraw %} --> directory in your Foundry userData folder and rename it from <!-- {% raw %} -->`boilerplate-master`<!-- {% endraw %} --> to your system's name (lowercase, machine-safe).
3. Search the directory for any files with the filename <!-- {% raw %} -->`boilerplate`<!-- {% endraw %} --> and rename them to your system's machine-safe name, such as <!-- {% raw %} -->`mysystemname`<!-- {% endraw %} -->.
4. Search the files for any occurrences of <!-- {% raw %} -->`Boilerplate`<!-- {% endraw %} --> (case-sensitive) and replace those with a capitalized version of your system name that's still machine-safe, such as <!-- {% raw %} -->`MySystemName`<!-- {% endraw %} -->. These are typically used for the classes in the Javascript files.
5. Search the files for any occurrences of <!-- {% raw %} -->`boilerplate`<!-- {% endraw %} --> (case-sensitive) and replace those with a lowercase machine-safe version of your system name, such as <!-- {% raw %} -->`mysystemname`<!-- {% endraw %} -->.
6. If the replace instructions from step 4 also included updating your description in system.json, you should edit that to be more readable now, such as "My System Name".

## Option 2:  Generate with npm

You'll need to be comfortable with your terminal/command line and have npm installed. If you are, run the following two commands:

<!--- {% raw %} --->

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-foundry
```

<!--- {% endraw %} --->

After that, you just need to open your <!-- {% raw %} -->`/Data/systems`<!-- {% endraw %} --> directory in your Foundry userData folder in your terminal and run

<!--- {% raw %} --->

```bash
yo foundry
```

<!--- {% endraw %} --->
to generate your system. The generator will ask you what your system name should be and will provide examples.
