In a dedicated hosting setting, the application runs on a persistent web server using node.js and all players (including the GM) connect to the game session. The dedicated hosting mode is most similar to the experience of Roll20 or Astral Tabletop.

# Advantages
- Your world is always online, although gameplay can be paused in between sessions
- Clients connect to your world regardless of local network configurations.
- Network transfer speeds are typically faster than self-hosted resulting in a better player experience.

# Disadvantages
- Requires a accessible web server which is configured to serve the Foundry VTT application.
- More complicated initial setup, especially for users who are unfamiliar with web hosting.
- Your worldâ€™s static files (maps, tokens, music) need to be served from a static location or from the web server.
