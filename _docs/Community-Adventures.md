* **Author**: u2mad#5354 on Discord

### Description
*A quick note by u2mad: I've gotten permission to distribute this from the folks at Frog God games as long as the book/pdf for the adventure is still required and it isn't being sold.

(Grabbed from the product page) An elaborate underground city, an ancient necromancer, an alliance of wizards, and an arcane prison form the backdrop for this ENnie award-winning adventure book. The book contains enough to challenge characters from level 2 to level 6, but it is much more than just an adventure resource. The Lost City of Barakus contains the Lost Lands campaign information for the City of Endhome, the Penprie Forest, and the Duskmoon Hills. And, of course, for the Lost City of Barakus itself. This 143-page book is filled with adventures, NPCs, and locations for the party to explore, interact with, and conquer.

For those seeking a low-cost starter book leading into a Lost Lands Campaign, containing lower-level adventures, we recommend either this book or Stoneheart Valley. If a city is something you definitely want in your starting area, then the City of Endhome in Lost City of Barakus is probably the deciding factor between the two books.

## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices

- Links to adventures should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the adventure author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the adventure author deems important. If you have the adventure author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the adventure download link. 
- Adventures are sorted by system compatibility and then alphabetically.
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   
- Ideally, each adventure should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 
- Adventures should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
