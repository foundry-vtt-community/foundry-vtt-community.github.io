The token HUD let’s you quickly access and edit multiple token attributes that are likely to change during the course of combat. It is accessed by right-clicking a token.

# Number Fields
The field on the left which appears with a small arrow is the elevation field, used to track the vertical position of the token, its height. Two additional number fields can also appear above and below the token. These correspond to the tracked attributes of the token, if any. When opened, the HUD will display the current value for each of these attributes, but that’s not all! These areas are mainly there to easily edit those values. This can be done in two ways: math input, or override. Thus, you could either type in the math value to be added or removed from the current value, or simply set a new value (without any operator before the number).

# Settings
The more detailed token configuration window can be accessed using the cogwheel below the elevation field.

# Hidden Toggle
The masked man on the right of the token let’s the GM set the visibility status of the token. If hidden, the token will appear semi-transparent ot the GM, and will not appear at all for the players.

# Status Symbols
_Note:_ for now, these are merely symbols which have no specific meaning attached. You can use them however you want to represent what your heart desires, but they aren’t linked to any condition effect or anything of the sorts.

To set a status icon on a token, you simply have to click on the desired icon and it will be added over the token. You can have as many of those on a token at once as you want. Alternatively, you may **right click** an icon to set it over the entire token. You can only have one big icon on a given token at a time. Notice that the smaller icons are still present.

Note that the small icons will also appear beside the token in the combat tracker if it is in a combat encounter, and that if the token is set as defeated (skull icon) in the combat tracker and the token currently has no big status icon overlay, the skull will automatically become the big overlay icon for the token­.

# Combat Toggle
The last button on the token HUD is the combat toggle button. It only appears for tokens on the active scene and let’s you add the token to the current encounter.
