Foundry VTT is a self-hosted platform. This means that somebody is hosting a game on a server that they own or operate or rent. If you are not this person, you will need to contact the host for connection information. You will need an **IP & Port Number** or a **Domain Name**.
Once connected to the host's server, click on the **Select Player** dropdown, and click the username the host created for you. You may also need an **Access Key** before you can connect to the game.
