# Basic Setup
1. Download the latest Windows setup file from [Patreon](https://patreon.com/foundryvtt/posts)
2. Run `FoundryVTT-0.4.X-Setup.dmg` to install Foundry VTT
Note: The .dmg is currently not signed, so you will need to allow the installation when prompted
3. Follow the instructions to install Foundry.
Note: If you select Run Foundry VTT at the end of installation you may be prompted to allow it through the macOS firewall.   
4. When finished installed Foundry will open as a full screen application on the "Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Configuration and Setup" screen.

# Running From Terminal

Download the Window's version of Foundry and place it in a suitable location, such as **Documents**. Double click on the `FoundryVirtualTabletop-win32-x64.zip` to extract the contents. I suggest renaming the folder that was created to **FoundryVTT**.

In order to run the Foundry server we need to download `node.js` for macOS. It is suggested to install `node.js` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for ease of installation and managment.

To install Homebrew, open up the **Terminal** application and copy the following command
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Press the `return` key.

During installation it will ask for a password, this is the password that used login to macOS. Once typed, press the `return` key.

Once complete you should see *Installation successful!*

With Homebrew installed we can now install `node.js` to do this enter the following command in **Terminal**
```
brew install node.js
```
Press the `return` key.

With `node.js` installed we can now run the Foundry server. Assuming you placed and named the extracted Foundry folder in your **Documents** and named it **FoundryVTT** you can type the following command replacing the folder names if needed
```
cd /Documents/FoundryVTT
```
Press the `return` key.

Now that we are inside the Foundry folder we can run the Foundry server by running this command
```
node resources/app/main.js
```
Press the `return` key.

Now depending on the version of macOS you may get a prompt to allow node to accept incoming network connections, press **Allow**.

You should now see something similar to this in your terminal
