### Pathfinder 2
The templates require a bit of manipulation to use with Pathfinder 2's standard area of effect templates, but you can do everything except cones larger than 15 feet.  The first entry in the following lists is the Pathfinder 2 template, the second part describes how to make it using Foundry's template tool. If you're running PF2, I suggest copying this into a journal page that you share with the players for easier reference in game.

**Bursts**
* 5 ft = 5 ft circle from origin, which is the intersection of 4 squares
* 10 ft = 10 ft circle from origin
* 15 ft = 13.5 ft circle from origin (go down a bit to get this length)
* 20 ft = 18.2 ft circle from origin (go down a bit to get this length)
* 30 ft = 28 ft circle from origin (go down a bit to get this length)

**Cones**
* 15 ft diagonal = 14.1 ft flat cone from centre of caster's square
* 15 ft orthogonal = 15 ft flat cone from centre of caster's square
* 30 ft cones = impossible with templates, can do with tiles?
* 60 ft cones = impossible with templates, can do with tiles?

Note, you need to have "flat" as your cone template type in the 'configure game settings' menu.

**Emanations**

_From medium creature:_
* 5 ft = 15 ft rectangle
* 10 ft = 12.5 circle (from centre of creature's tile)

_From large creature:_
* 5 ft = 20 ft rectangle
* 10 ft = 15 ft circle (from centre of creature's tile)
 
**Lines**
* 30 ft straight = 30 ft straight
* 30 ft down one = 30 ft down one
* 30 ft down two = 28 ft down two
* 30 ft diagonal = 28 ft diagonal
* 60 ft straight = 60 ft straight
* 60 ft diagonal = 56.6 ft diagonal* 60 ft down 3 = start from far corner of space, go 55 ft over and down
