## FateX

* **Translation Support**: EN (Full), DE, SP, FR
### Link(s) to Game System	
* Repository: [https://github.com/anvil-vtt/FateX](https://github.com/anvil-vtt/FateX)
* Manifest URL: [https://github.com/anvil-vtt/FateX/releases/latest/download/system.json](https://github.com/anvil-vtt/FateX/releases/latest/download/system.json)
### Description
FateX is the extended Fate game system for FoundryVTT. This system allows you to play any Fate game you want. It provides default options for playing Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, and Fate Condensed, but can be used in all its derivative systems too.

You're able to define your own aspects, skill lists, stress tracks, consequences, conditions, stunts, extras, and more.

Using the "Actor template system", you're able to create and manage multiple templates which new actors may be based on. This allows you to have different base-sheets for PCs, NPCs, monsters, and any other type of character you can imagine.

It's possible to use different mechanics for different character types. For example: while PCs may have core-style stress tracks (1,2,3,4), NPCs could have condensed style stress tracks (1,1,1,1). You're fully flexible to play the Fate game you want.
Installation

For manual installation, use the provided manifest URL in the "Install System" popup window while managing game systems.

[7th Sea](https://www.chaosium.com/7th-sea/) is a tabletop roleplaying game of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Théah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe.

Players take on the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and protecting the rightful kings and queens of Théah from murderous villains. It is a world of sharp blades and sharp wits, where a cutting retort can be just as deadly as a sword’s point.

# Appendix	

## Appendix A: Best Editing Practices	

- Links to game systems should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the game system author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the game system author deems important. If you have the game system author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the game system download link. 	
- Game Systems are sorted by system compatibility, then function, and then alphabetically.	
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing, unless it is the system title, or the module author desires otherwise in the description. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   	
- Ideally, each game system should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 	
- Game Systems should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
