## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices

- Links to rollable tables should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the table author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the table author deems important. If you have the table author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the adventure download link. 
- Tables are sorted by system compatibility and then alphabetically.
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   
- Ideally, each table should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 
- Tables should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.

## Appendix C: Importing & Exporting Tables

- Table Data is stored at `\resources\app\public\worlds\(your world)\data` in the `tables.db` file
- All of the data for a table is stored on a single line
**Exporting**
- To export table data just: select, copy, and paste the line with the table you want to export
**Importing**
- To import table data just: copy the data of the table you want, paste the data as a new line in the `tables.db` file
