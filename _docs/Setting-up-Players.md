One important final setup step is to create and configure the Players who will be joining your game. You should create a User record for each player you expect to join your game. Control of Actors and other permissions are configured at the User level, so having different users allows you to give players access to different content.

To access this menu you will need to be inside of a World. Click on "Game Settings" and then "Configure Players". This window will allow a Gamemaster to create, edit, or delete User records.

Each Player has 3 properties
* **User Name**: Name as it will appear on the start-up screen when joining a World.
* **Access Key**: A simple password used to restrict access for each Player. The Gamemaster will have to give this password to the Player in order for them to connect.
* **Permission Level**: Defines what capabilities a Player will have (NONE, PLAYER, TRUSTED, ASSISTANT, or GAMEMASTER). The levels are detailed below.

**⚠️ Warning ⚠️**
> The Access Keys used in Foundry Virtual Tabletop are NOT cryptographically secure. Please do not reuse any password that you also use for other important accounts or services.

# Permission Levels

## None
Similar to the Player level of permission. Users with this role can be given token sight, but are unable to move actors on the canvas.

## Player
The most basic level of permission. Players can join the game and be given access to control or observe Actors and Items. Basic player accounts do not have some of the permissions which Trusted Players possess.

## Trusted Player
A player flagged as “trusted” has some additional capabilities beyond that of an ordinary player. Trusted players can be allowed access to upload image files to the host’s file system (token artwork, for example). Trusted players are also allowed to place AoE measurement templates on the game canvas.

## Assistant Gamemaster
An assistant GM is similar to a regular GameMaster, they can see the entire game canvas and can create or edit all content. Some permissions are limited, however: Assistant GMs are not allowed to delete Actors, Scenes, or Items.

## Gamemaster
Users with the Gamemaster permission level have full control over the world and it’s data. Be cautious which users you allow to have GM permission, and it is advisable to assign an access key for any GM players.

# First Time
Before inviting your first player it is recommended that Gamemasters create a User that can be used for testing content from the perspective of a Player. Even without a specific player in mind for your world, this is an important learning tool.
