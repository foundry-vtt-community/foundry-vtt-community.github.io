### Description
This game is a blasphemous game of Cosmic Horror... should be.
(As far as I know, it's heavily paradise-colored, like Delta Green.)
As those of you who have been playing for a long time will know,A lot of 
character sheets are lost in the Chaosium campaign.
So I needed to create a character sheet right away, and I put the Actor sheet in text format.
The folder "Character sheet template.txt" is the text template of 7htED.
There are many reasons for the text method, but one of the big ones is that you can 
just copy and paste a template to lose it on the
spot and write a character sheet right away, saving you the hassle of data entry.
There are many reasons for the text method, but one of the big ones is to lose it 
on the spot and write the character sheet right away, eliminating the hassle of 
data entry. You just need to copy and paste the template.
The other reason is that it's flexible to other supplements 
(because the system itself can be played on 6thED). Both the original settings and the 
attachability are great.
All that's left is to play the game as usual, with items listed as weapons.
It's still under development, so there's no special system.

# Appendix	

## Appendix A: Adding a Game System	

**Copy and paste the outline below in writing up new game system descriptions, formatting and all!**	
```	
## (Game System Name)	
* **Author**: (Put author’s name here, including Discord username. If they accept contributions in code or donations, note this here as well.)	
* **Version**: (Note current version of game system here.)	
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: (Note which versions of Foundry Virtual Tabletop the game system is compatible with.)	
* **Translation Support**: (Note which languages are supported, and if they have (full) or (partial) translations.	
### Link(s) to Game System	
* (Put a web URL here to find the game system.)	
* (Put the manifest url here to update/install the game system.)	
### Description	
(Describe the game system here. This should include the game system’s function, installation instructions, and anything important to note. Due to the particular oddities of some archiving programs (WinRar, 7zip), and GitHub zip folders, including a screenshot of what the module should look like file-wise in the “public/systems/examplesystem” is appreciated, though not required.)

```	

## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices	

- Links to game systems should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the game system author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the game system author deems important. If you have the game system author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the game system download link. 	
- Game Systems are sorted by system compatibility, then function, and then alphabetically.	
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing, unless it is the system title, or the module author desires otherwise in the description. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   	
- Ideally, each game system should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 	
- Game Systems should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
