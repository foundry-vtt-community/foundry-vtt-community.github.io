These example configurations are for setting up Apache2 as a reverse proxy for Foundry, and apply to Foundry versions 0.5.6 or later. Compatibility with 0.5.5 and below is not guaranteed, although the RewriteRule method is reported to work.

The important change for Foundry 0.5.6+ is the correct forwarding of the websocket requests. If it is not done properly, expect to see the "Join Game Session" button greyed out and stuck as "Loading...", with a 400 error shown in the browser console. 

Note that most `ProxyPass` type directives are not allowed in `.htaccess` files, so the configuration must be done in the appropriate `.conf` files.

### Foundry Configuration

First, although not Apache specific, ensure your Foundry configuration is set to work from behind a reverse proxy to match your Apache configuration. For example, set the options in `foundrydata/Config/options.json` file like:
```
"hostname": "vtt.example.com",
"port": 30000,
"routePrefix": null,
"sslCert": null,
"sslKey": null,
"proxySSL": true,
"proxyPort": 443,
```

### RewriteRule Method

This method requires mod_rewrite (reference [here](https://www.happyassassin.net/posts/2018/11/23/reverse-proxying-websockets-with-apache-a-generic-approach-that-works-even-with-firefox/)) as well as mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http, and maybe mod_proxy_wstunnel modules enabled.

Note that while this method is versatile and should "just work" without modification for most installations, performance may not be as good as a specific websocket ProxyPass, as described in the ProxyPass and wstunnel Method section below.

Replace `vtt.example.com` with your domain name where appropriate, and `localhost:30000` to match your Foundry server and port. If you happen to be running Foundry in SSL mode, also change occurrences of `http://` to `https://` and `ws://` to `wss://`.

```

# Uses LetsEncrypt/certbot to manage SSL certificates, which needs to be
# configured separately (https://certbot.eff.org/instructions)
# Note, requires mod_proxy mod_proxy_http mod_proxy_wstunnel as well as usual
# modules for SSL etc.

```
### ProxyPass and wstunnel Method

This method uses mod_proxy_wstunnel and a specific `ProxyPass` line for the Foundry websocket traffic. It should provide better performance than using the RewriteRule method, as per the performance warning on the [Apache RewriteRule Flags page](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/flags.html) for use of the `[P]` (proxy) flag:

> Using this flag triggers the use of mod_proxy, without handling of persistent connections. This means the performance of your proxy will be better if you set it up with ProxyPass or ProxyPassMatch. This is because this flag triggers the use of the default worker, which does not handle connection pooling/reuse. Avoid using this flag and prefer those directives, whenever you can.

Note, however, that in this method the `ProxyPass  "/socket.io/" "ws://localhost:30000/socket.io/"` line may require modification to match your server and/or Foundry routeprefix etc, unlike the RewriteRule method.

The `ProxyPass  "/socket.io/" "ws://localhost:30000/socket.io/"` line must come before the `ProxyPass / http://localhost:30000/`, as the more specific rules must be specified first.

Replace `vtt.example.com` with your domain name where appropriate, and `localhost:30000` to match your Foundry server and port. If you happen to be running Foundry in SSL mode, also change occurrences of `http://` to `https://` and `ws://` to `wss://`.
