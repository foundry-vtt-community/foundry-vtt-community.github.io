This configuration is intended for use with Foundry 0.5.6 or later. Compatibility with 0.5.5 and below is not guaranteed.

This example configuration is for setting up Apache2 as a reverse proxy for Foundry. The important change for Foundry 0.5.6 is the correct forwarding of the websocket requests. If it is not done properly, expect to see the "Join Game Session" button greyed out and stuck as "Loading...", with a 400 error shown in the browser console. 

This first example requires mod_rewrite (reference [here](https://www.happyassassin.net/posts/2018/11/23/reverse-proxying-websockets-with-apache-a-generic-approach-that-works-even-with-firefox/)) as well as mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http, and maybe mod_proxy_wstunnel modules enabled.

Replace `vtt.example.com` with your domain name where appropriate, and `localhost:30000` to match your Foundry server and port. If you happen to be running Foundry in SSL mode, also change occurrences of `http://` to `https://` and `ws://` to `wss://`.

```
# Apache .conf for reverse proxy of Foundry VTT.
# Uses LetsEncypt/certbot to manage SSL certificates, which needs to be
# configured separately (https://certbot.eff.org/instructions)
# Note, requires mod_proxy mod_proxy_http mod_proxy_wstunnel as well as usual
# modules for SSL etc.

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    # Change localhost:30000 if your Foundry instance is running on a
    # different server or port.
    # Additionally, if you are running Foundry with SSL enabled, change
    # any ws:// to wss:// and any http:// to https://
    # If you have Foundry configured to use a routeprefix, then no modifications
    # should be needed to anything here, it should just work.
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:30000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:30000/
    # The following rewrite will modify websocket requests to pass them properly
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule .* "ws://localhost:30000%{REQUEST_URI}" [P]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName vtt.example.com
    Redirect permanent / https://vtt.example.com/
</VirtualHost>
```

Additionally, though not Apache specific, ensure your Foundry configuration is set to work from behind a reverse proxy to match your Apache configuration. For example, for the above, set the options in `foundrydata/Config/options.json` file like:
```
"hostname": "vtt.example.com",
"port": 30000,
"routePrefix": null,
"sslCert": null,
"sslKey": null,
"proxySSL": true,
"proxyPort": 443,
```



Another less flexible method is to use mod_proxy_wstunnel and a specific `ProxyPass` line for the Foundry websocket traffic. It may be worth trying if the above general method does not work:
```
# Apache .conf for reverse proxy of Foundry VTT.
# Uses LetsEncypt/certbot to manage SSL certificates, which needs to be
# configured separately (https://certbot.eff.org/instructions)
# Note, requires mod_proxy mod_proxy_http mod_proxy_wstunnel as well as usual
# modules for SSL etc.
