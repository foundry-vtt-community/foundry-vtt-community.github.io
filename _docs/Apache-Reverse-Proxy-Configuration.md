This configuration is intended for use with Foundry 0.5.6 or later.  Compatibility with 0.5.5 and below is not guaranteed.

Example configuration for setting up Apache2 as a reverse proxy for Foundry.  The list of modules required are in the comments at the start.  Credit to @Failbot42 on Discord for this.

Replace vtt.example.com with your domain name where appropriate.

```# Apache .conf for reverse proxy of Foundry VTT.
# Uses LetsEncypt/certbot to manage SSL certificates, which needs to be
# configured separately (https://certbot.eff.org/instructions)
# Note, requires mod_proxy mod_proxy_http mod_proxy_wstunnel as well as usual
# modules for SSL etc.
